    Hello and welcome to PRELOAD. A publication exploring the intersections between code, art, and design. These tutorials make no prior assumption as to skills related to coding, you can start here with no coding skills at all and make something by the end of it. But it also it not only for beginners, this magazine will cover various different JavaScript libraries such as p5.js and THREE.js, using SVGs in the DOM as well as introducing many tips and tricks, addons and approaches that may be useful to intermediate coders and even seasoned professionals.

    I encourage you to explore your wildest imagination, make accidents, collaborate, and even upload your creations online.Embracing your accidents is a fundamental part of this magazine. In both creative arts and design, and coding, accidents are how we learn but also how we may suprise ourselves,  nd new avenues of expression, a channel the sense of playfulness inherit in creative coding. This means that creative coding neednâ€™t all be digital, if you love to work only with analogue textures and collage, this can be pushed forward with creative coding without losing your visual language or style. Coding adds a edge, and works alongside your work without enforcing itself onto it, it means that you can also publish your work for the whole world to see instantaneously online, so without further ado, lets get coding.

    Open-source tutorial guide coming soon.
